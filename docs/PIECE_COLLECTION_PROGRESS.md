# Chess Piece Collection Progress

## Summary
Successfully collected and prepared a comprehensive chess piece training dataset with 3,888 images across 13 classes (12 piece types + empty squares).

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Downloaded Lichess Piece Sets
- **Downloaded 6 piece sets**: cburnett, merida, alpha, pirouetti, spatial, horsey
- **Total**: 72 SVG files (6 sets × 12 pieces)
- **Source**: Official Lichess GitHub repository
- **License**: Open source, free to use

### 2. Converted SVGs to Training Data
- **Converted to PNG**: 3,456 piece images
- **Multiple backgrounds**: 16 different chess board colors
- **Multiple sizes**: 64×64, 96×96, 128×128 pixels
- **Variations**: Each piece rendered on both light and dark squares

### 3. Generated Empty Squares
- **Created**: 192 empty square samples
- **Variations**: Plain, noise, gradient, wood texture
- **Backgrounds**: All common board colors

### 4. Applied Augmentations
- **Augmented**: 240 additional images
- **Types**: Horizontal flip, brightness adjustment, blur
- **Purpose**: Increase training data variety

## Scripts Created

1. **download_chess_pieces.py**
   - Downloads open-source chess piece sets
   - Currently supports Lichess pieces
   - Provides info on other datasets

2. **prepare_piece_training_data.py**
   - Converts SVG to PNG with various backgrounds
   - Generates empty square samples
   - Applies augmentations
   - Creates training summary

3. **download_additional_datasets.py**
   - Guide for manually downloading more datasets
   - Links to Roboflow, Kaggle, GitHub sources
   - Instructions for each dataset

4. **extract_pieces_from_roboflow.py**
   - Extracts individual pieces from Roboflow dataset
   - Uses YOLO bounding box annotations
   - Ready to use when dataset is downloaded

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. **Download Additional Datasets**:
   - Roboflow Chess Dataset (292 images with annotations)
   - Kaggle Chess Pieces (7,000+ individual pieces)
   - GitHub datasets for more variety

2. **Train Enhanced Model**:
   - Use new training data with existing model architecture
   - Compare performance with original model

### Future Improvements
1. **Real Photo Collection**:
   - Photograph actual chess sets
   - Various lighting conditions
   - Different board angles

2. **Style Variety**:
   - More piece styles (glass, marble, themed sets)
   - Tournament sets
   - Digital board screenshots

3. **Data Quality**:
   - Manual review of generated images
   - Remove any low-quality samples
   - Ensure balanced class distribution

## Technical Notes

- **Cairo Library**: Required for SVG conversion. Install with: `brew install cairo`
- **Image Formats**: All pieces saved as PNG with transparency handled
- **Naming Convention**: `{set_name}_{piece_code}_bg{background_id}_s{size}.png`

## Impact on Recognition

With 308 images per piece class (compared to limited training data before), we expect:
- Better recognition of different piece styles
- Improved performance on real photographs
- More robust to lighting variations
- Better handling of different board colors

The combination of synthetic data (Lichess SVGs) and real photographs (from additional datasets) should significantly improve the model's ability to recognize pieces in various conditions.
